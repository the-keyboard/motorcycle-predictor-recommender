PROPOSAL
This group intended to create a Motorcycle Recommendation System, which will be customized to suit every userâ€™s customized needs. It is designed to make the selection of bikes, which can often
be a lengthy and difficult procedure, extremely easy. Users can input their motorcycle preferences into our system, and using AI Training models, it will grade every single motorcycle in our extensive
database which matches the base criteria on a scale of 0 to 99, and shows the user the 10 bikes which have the highest score. The aim of the project was updated to include a price prediction model
for the bikes, where the bike user can input the specifications of a new model of bike, and our project is designed to not only give the user the predicted price for this new model, but also give 
the top 10 highest scored bikes according to the aforementioned method.
